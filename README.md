# PIDSim
PIDSim is a tool for simulating and visualizing the tuning of PID controllers. It is intended as a teaching tool for new FRC robotics programmers, to allow them to familiarize themselves with PID controllers and gain an intuitive understanding of how they work and the process of tuning them.

PIDSim is built using the Qt5 GUI toolkit from Qt (https://www.qt.io/) and is based in part on the work of the Qwt project (http://qwt.sf.net). To comply with the licensing requirements of Qt and Qwt, and to allow PIDSim to be distributed in a statically-linked form, PIDSim is licensed under the LGPL and all source code is available in this repository.
